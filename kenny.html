<header id="soccer"> <h2> How we met</h2> </header>
<p> From what I remember is that we were in the gym. I was chilling, living life, and out of no where you approached me. You started talking to me and I was shy. I was around my uncles and friends and they were surprised and shocked that we talked. It was pretty funny but yea from there I didn't know our long journey would begin. </p>
<header> This is a website that I plan on updating and polishing more and more as our time progresses, this marks where I begin to finally start doing something with I learn and know and I hope you enjoy it.  </header>
